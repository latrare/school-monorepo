Folder in src: minishell or myminishell

Create new function /my/src/my_str2vect.c
char **my_str2vect(char *str);

Clean:
str argument is to be considered IMMUTABLE.
Create vector with pointer to new strings

"ls          -l" => {"ls", " ", "-l"} (ignore extra spaces)

Tabs should also be treated same as whitespaces

Can be done in 3 parses total (of input string).

Free the vector given:
my_freevect(char **);

Freeing of vectors will be checked.


minishell
---
Runner of stuff.
At first, display prompt. PROMPT #>
Show output of command below prompt, then display prompt again.
DO NOT HANDLE REDIRECTIONS, AMPERSANDS, PIPES, OR WILDCARDS

Have to handle:
---
* cd blah
* ls
* pwd
* exit - should print a goodbye message
* everything else is a program you have to exec
bad commands, if it doesn't exist, print error message and command used

Necessary functions (allowed):
---
getcwd() - current dir program is in
chdir() - change dir program is in (don't do before fork, do in parent after)
fork()
execvp()
read()
wait*()

Structure:
---
main process
while(1) in process until exit is typed
parent will handle cd and exit commands
read, str2vect, check command, fork, execvp in child (if it doesn't work, print command that failed, then error)
